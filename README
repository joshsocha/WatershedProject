=================================
CS4791 (Senior Design), Fall 2013
       Setup documentation       
=================================

=== INTRODUCTION ===
TODO. Seriously, we don't even know what this project
is supposed to DO yet.

=== INSTALLATION ===

1) Prepare a basic LAMP or WAMP server. If you
   elect to do the former, we assume you know
   what you're doing. In the later case, we
   highly recommend installing XAMPP.

2) Download a working copy of the mercurial repository.
   If you're reading this, odds are you've done that.

3) The folder containing this README is the root of
   your web server. Whether this is your main server
   or a virtual host, you will need these things:

   a) mod_rewrite.
   b) php5 (any minor version).
   c) Any mysql module.

4) Visit the INSTALLATION folder, contained in this root.

   a) Prepare a new database for this project, if you haven't already.
   b) Run ion_auth.sql on that database.

5) ??? (TODO)

6) Profit!

=== CURRENT TODOS (Major) ===

1) Better reporting system. Seriously, using the README
   is about as temporary as it can get.

2) Make sure everyone knows to use lang("string_key"), never hardcode strings.

3) Finish integrating IonAuth
   a) Create custom login related pages (login/out, pw reset, etc etc) with OUR theme.
   b) See if IonAuth can be attached to a global hook/route, to avoid boilerplate code.

4) Expand installation instructions above

5) Integrate bootstrap

6) Add project to mercurial repository for others to see.
